Computer Vision - Deepfake Detection model - Comparative Study
This project focuses on detecting deepfake images generated by GANs using deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It utilizes real images from Flickr and fake images from NVIDIAâ€™s StyleGAN to train the model. Additionally, transfer learning architectures like DenseNet and InceptionNet are employed and compared against a custom CNN for improved deepfake detection accuracy.
